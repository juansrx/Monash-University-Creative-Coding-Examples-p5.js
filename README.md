# Monash-University-Creative-Coding-Examples-p5.js
Sketches ported to p5 from the Monash University Creative Coding Course found at FutureLearn given by Jon McCormack from Monash University. Separated by weeks.

I hope this can be useful for people a) Learning p5 b) Learning javascript c) Knowing p5 from a processing context.
